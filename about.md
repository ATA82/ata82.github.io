# About Singular Insights

**Singular Insights** is dedicated to exploring bioinformatics solutions to 
challenging questions in molecular biology. My approach centers on explaining 
key mathematical methods within the specific context of molecular biology. 
Typically, there's a gap between the way methods are taught in a didactic 
setting and how they are applied in real-world scientific research. By embedding 
these mathematical methods into concrete examples from molecular biology and 
bioinformatics, this platform aims to illuminate their nuances and practical 
applications. This contextualized approach is designed to bridge the gap between 
theoretical instruction and scientific practice.

## What You Can Expect

I will not promise to post frequently, but I will aim to share content that is 
both of practical relevance and that bridges the gap between theory and practice.

The content will be diverse and depends on my day-to-day experiences interacting 
with many scientific researchers and encountering challenging questions along this 
journey. Sometimes it might be an **In-Depth Tutorial** or a context-specific 
approach to explain **mathematical models**, and at other times an opinion on 
current topics in molecular biology and related disciplines from the perspective 
of a bioinformatician. This is my main focus at the moment.

However, from time to time I may revisit my roots as a computer scientist and 
provide content on general topics in this field, including the subject of our 
time, **Artificial Intelligence**. And because I believe that science and ethics 
must go hand in hand, I might also address ethical questions related to science.

My overall aim is to make complex topics within my field more accessible and 
engaging.

## About Me

I'm a dedicated bioinformatician at the intersection of biology, medicine, and 
data science. With an advanced background in bioinformatics research, I 
specialize in transforming complex data into clear, actionable insights. 

My work is rooted in:
- **Omics Data Analysis:** Leveraging transcriptomics, genomics proteomics, and 
other high-throughput data to uncover biological patterns.
- **Software Development:** 
Crafting robust, user-friendly tools that streamline scientific data analysis 
and visualization.
- **Methods Development:** 
Innovating and refining mathematical and computational techniques tailored to 
the nuances of molecular biology.
- **Open Science:** Actively sharing insights, methodologies, and code to 
foster a collaborative and transparent scientific community.

I believe that making the complexities at the convergence of biology, medicine, 
and data science accessible empowers researchers, students, and enthusiasts alike.
